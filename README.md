# Drivers-Drving-Behaviour-analysis
**Abstract**
—There are many causes for occurrence of a traffic accident, but one of the main causes is Driver’s distraction or fatigue or drowsiness. However, initial signs of sleepiness or drowsiness can be detected before
 a critical situation arises. Driving behaviors analysis is a step to understand the driver’s characteristics and behaviors and is useful to reduce the traffic accidents even by a small amount. Driver’s behavior 
 can be classified into normal if he’s active and not distracted by any circumstances and not sleepy. It’s classified as abnormal when the driver is fatigued, sleepy or drowsy. By this we can determine his 
 behavior and alert the person who’s driving at that moment. All the prior works failed to meet the runtime accuracy requirements and mostly relied on only one mode of data collection. This causes a low accuracy 
 result which may not be useful and might be a point of failure. In conclusion, this project provides a drivers drowsiness detection system which is helpful for society.The Project’s detection 
 methods are reliable for the accurate result without causing any disturbance to the driver.
